# 🌬️ Tailwind CSS Practice

This repository is created to practice and learn **Tailwind CSS**.  
It currently contains **basic experiments**, notes, and small UI trials made by me while learning Tailwind’s utility-first styling approach.

## 📘 Purpose

- Understanding Tailwind utility classes  
- Practicing layouts (flex, grid, spacing, alignment)  
- Learning responsive design  
- Experimenting with components  
- Building a foundation for future Tailwind projects  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS**
- **HTML5**
- **JavaScript** (for small interactions, optional)

## 🚧 Status

There are **no complete projects yet** — this repo is mainly for:

- Trying out Tailwind classes  
- Creating small components  
- Testing layouts  
- Learning step-by-step  

More components and practice files will be added soon.
